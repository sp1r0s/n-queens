# N Queens fast solution 

This is my take on the popular problem. I am trying to solve the problem in 2 stages. 

1) Initial placement of the queens in the chessboard, so there is at most 1 conflict
 
2) Try to resolve the 1 conflict, by trying different combinations

I manage to solve 1000x1000 in less than 1 second!
